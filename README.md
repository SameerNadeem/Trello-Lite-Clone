I will lead the development of a Trello clone application using a comprehensive technology stack that includes Angular, Typescript, NodeJS with Express, MongoDB, and Socket IO. 
 
My objective is to create a functional fullstack application where users can organize tasks, collaborate on boards, and experience real-time updates. Through Angular and Typescript, I will craft an interactive frontend, while the backend, powered by NodeJS and Express, will handle data management and user authentication.
 
MongoDB will serve as our database, enabling efficient storage of user-generated content. The integration of Socket IO will allow us to facilitate seamless real-time communication between users. The end result will be a deployed production-ready application, showcasing the successful implementation of a Trello-inspired platform that covers aspects ranging from UI development to backend logic and real-time interactions.
